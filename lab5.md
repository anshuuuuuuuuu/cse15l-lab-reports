# LAB REPORT 5 - Putting it All Together (Week 9)

## Reflection 

I really found this class interesting to take before beginning with other CS classes. Even though I did not give my best in the class, I was amazed 
by the concept of vim. The second half was really hectic for me but I enjoyed the rush and emotions.
