the lab report shows the concept of bugs and explores the command line options for grep
## PART 1

### Failure-Inducing Input:

```
@Test
public void testGetFiles_Failure() throws IOException {
    File start = new File("some-files/even-more-files/");
    List<File> actualFiles = FileExample.getFiles(start);
    // This list should include all files in 'even-more-files' directory and its subdirectories
    List<File> expectedFiles = Arrays.asList(
        new File("some-files/even-more-files/d.java"),
        new File("some-files/even-more-files/a.txt")
        // Add other files if any subdirectories exist
    );
    assertEquals(expectedFiles, actualFiles);
}
```

### Non Failure-inducing input 
```
@Test
public void testGetFiles_Success() throws IOException {
    File start = new File("some-files/a.txt");
    List<File> actualFiles = FileExample.getFiles(start);
    // This list should only contain 'a.txt' as it is a file, not a directory
    List<File> expectedFiles = Collections.singletonList(
        new File("some-files/a.txt")
    );
    assertEquals(expectedFiles, actualFiles);
}

```

### Bug fix:
### Before:
```
static List<File> getFiles(File start) throws IOException {
    List<File> result = new ArrayList<>();
    result.add(start);
    if(start.isDirectory()) {
        File[] paths = start.listFiles();
        for(File subFile: paths) {
            result.add(subFile);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

```

### After:
```
static List<File> getFiles(File start) throws IOException {
    List<File> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if(start.isFile()) {
        result.add(start);
    } else if(start.isDirectory()) {
        File[] paths = start.listFiles();
        if(paths != null) {
            for(File subFile : paths) {
                result.addAll(getFiles(subFile));
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```


## PART 2

# grep -c [word] [file you want to search the word in]

### FUNCTION: This is used to count the number of lines that match a pattern within input text given.
### USE: It helps us find out recurring words/phrases in a large data set.

## EXAMPLE 1
```
Anshs-Air:technical anshpatel$ grep -c "was" 911report/chapter-1.txt
165
```
## EXAMPLE 2
```
Anshs-Air:technical anshpatel$ grep -c "is" 911report/chapter-3.txt
1071
```

# grep -n [searched word] [file you want to search]

### FUNCTION: It is used to give the line number for each matching word.
### USE: It helps us the specific lines where the same words exist. This can save a lot of time.

# grep -w [searched word] [file]

### FUNCTION: This is when you want to match just the whole words rather than including substrings.
### USE: It helps us when there are words that could include frequently used substrings.

## EXAMPLE 1
```

# grep -r [searched word] [directory]

### FUNCTION: This is when you want to search for matching patterns in all directories and subdirectories within the mentioned dir.
### USE: It helps us when there are words that could exist in multiple directories.

## EXAMPLE 1
